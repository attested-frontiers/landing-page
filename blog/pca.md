# Transforming Global Trade with Programmable Commercial Agreements

![container_ship](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkESsjI1lx.png)


## Introduction

When most people hear “blockchain” or “smart contracts,” what often comes to mind are tokens, decentralized finance protocols, or cross-chain infrastructure. While these are valid and well-known examples, they only scratch the surface of what the technology enables.

Thanks to advances in cryptography, attested data, and smart contract design, we now have the ability to do something far more ambitious: execute real-world commercial agreements onchain. This marks a shift from speculation to utility — from abstract assets to enforceable business logic. We call these Programmable Commercial Agreements (PCA).

## The Value of Digitizing Commercial Agreements on Blockchain

Commercial agreements have long underpinned trade — from handwritten contracts among ancient merchants to modern legal documents that govern trillions in global commerce. They define how goods move, payments are made, and risks are managed.

Yet, today’s contracts remain surprisingly analog. They're often siloed, slow to execute, hard to enforce across borders, and prone to fraud. These issues bog down supply chains, raise transaction costs, and create friction in global trade.

Programmable Commercial Agreements offer a digital-native alternative:

**Transparency and Trust**: Immutable records allow every party to verify terms and execution without relying on intermediaries.

**Automation with Smart Contracts**: Payments, shipments, and penalties can be automated through code, reducing errors and delays.

**Borderless Enforcement**: PCAs execute based on logic, not legal jurisdictions, streamlining international business.

**Cost and Time Efficiency**: Automating key processes eliminates the need for redundant paperwork and third-party verification.

**Seamless Integration**: Onchain agreements can interact directly with supply chain software, IoT devices, and oracles.

With PCAs, the potential is not just better contracts — it’s a better foundation for global commerce.

## Previous / Current Attempts

The idea of digitizing commercial agreements has long captivated technologists, economists, and legal scholars. Long before the rise of modern blockchains, the concept of Ricardian Contracts—introduced by Ian Grigg nearly 15 years before Bitcoin—envisioned machine-readable agreements that maintained legal enforceability. It was an early glimpse into what could become a transformative paradigm.

Over the past decade, various platforms have sought to bring this vision to life. These initiatives aimed to streamline trade, increase transparency, and reduce friction in global commerce through digital contracts and blockchain-based documentation. Yet, despite ambitious goals and notable progress, most efforts encountered limitations that ultimately curtailed their impact—whether due to privacy concerns, lack of interoperability, or difficulty integrating with entrenched legacy systems.

Below, we explore a few key initiatives that paved the way—what they aimed to solve, where they made progress, and why they ultimately couldn't achieve mass adoption. Understanding their journey provides valuable context for how our approach redefines what’s possible with Programmable Commercial Agreements.

### TradeLens

TradeLens was a platform launched in 2018 to tackle inefficiencies in global shipping. The motivation for launching this platform came from the fact that the fact that global trade was ripe with inefficiencies. International shipping is a complex process that involves many stakeholders such as, carries, ports, and ground transportation. It is easy for delays, fraud, lost documentation to occur in the multi-step process. Maersk, being a leader in global shipping, was uniquely well equipped to understand the problems plagueing the industry and patnered with IBM to launch TradeLens on IBM's HyperLedger Fabric blockchain.

At it's peak, TradeLens represented over 60% of container cargo across the globe. It had over 300 member organizations including major shipping companies, international ports, and customs authorities. Some of the more notable partnerships include the Netherlands and Singapore.

While TradeLens showed a lot of promise intially, it failed to attract the necessary level of interest from industry participants to truly cement itself. There were two major reasons for this: One is that transparent nature of Blockchain was a deterrent for many organizations. A lot of the data that would be required to be placed on-chain was confidential and not something to be broadcasted on a public network. Additionally other organizations found it difficult to pivot to TradeLens as their legacy systems were already deeply ingrained in their business models. Ultimately TradeLens shut down in early 2023, living short of its dream to transform the global supply chain 

### we.trade
we.trade was a finance platform that was formed in 2017 between 9 European banks, originally branded as the "Digital Trade Chain". It aimed to simplify international trade transactions for small to medium sized businesses

One of the primary focusses of we.trade was doing away with paper Letters of Credit (LC). Instead of reliance on LCs a bank would issue a Bank Payment Undertaking (BPU). In this model the buyer's bank would give a gurantee that a seller is paid once the terms of the trade specified in a smart contract are fulfiled. Another digital payment gurantee provided by we.trade was a Payment Commitment (PC). A PC would be an irrevocable commitment to pay the seller guranteed on the blockchain

The platform expanded its consortium to eventually include 15 banks spread across 16 countries. In 2020 they partnered with IBM in hopes of further expansion with IBM becoming a major shareholder in the organization. Despite all this, in 2022 the platform faced financial challenges that were further exacerbated by a major investor that pulled the plug last minute. These challenges eventually led to we.trade ceasing operations in 2022

### Wave BL

Wave BL is a company focussed on digitizing trade documents. Founded in 2015 out Kfar Saba, Israel, their goal is to make trade more efficient by getting rid of paper-based trade documentation to reduce risk, enhance security, and expedite trade. Their platform has been adopted by large shipping companies such as MSC, ZIM, and ONE.

One of their primary focusses is Electronic Bills of Lading (EBLs). In the third quarter of 2022 over 100,000 were processed which marks a 11% uptick from previous quarters. Additionally in October 2024 they completed a Proof of Value (POV) collaboration with Swift and several global banks. Now EBLs can be exchanged easily amount SWIFT members without requiring additional software. They employ a proprietary blockchain

Wave BL is still in operation today and closed a $37 million Series B in 2024. They control 65% of the market share of EBLs as of April 2025 and are currently operating in 130 different countries. It demonstrates that global commerce is primed to benefit from blockchain and that the attitude is shifting in regards of adopting blockchain as a 

### CargoX

CargoX is a company founded in 2018 that is similar to Wave BL in the sense they employ EBLs. Unlike them they offer a much broader array of digitized agreements such as LCs and certificates. They operate on the Ethereum blockchain unlike Wave BL which employs a proprietary system.

In 2018 they launched their Smart B/L platform which marked the first open and neutral shipping platform built on blockchain. In October of that same year they completed the first blockchain transfer of a Bill of Lading. This accomplishment gained enough recognition that they won Best Blockchain Innovation of the Year at the Transport & Logistics Middle East Excellence Awards the following year. In 2021 they were authorized to operate on Egypt's NAFEZA platforms to facilitate document transfer over blockchain

As of April 2025 CargoX continues to operate and expand its reach in the digitization of commercial documents. Their Blockchain Document Transfer (BDT) platform allows for the tokenization of a variety of trade documents. Used by 135,000 companies and processing more than 8 million trade documents across 190 countries, they are another example that the world

## How Our Approach Sets a New Standard for Programmable Commercial Agreements

![maritime_routes](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1JsujLxex.png)


While earlier initiatives mentioned above laid important groundwork in digitizing trade and commercial documentation, they each faced critical roadblocks—be it lack of transparency, limited interoperability, inflexible legacy integration, or unsustainable business models. Our platform takes a radically improved approach by combining programmable automation, secure financial verification, and robust privacy—natively on-chain.

### Native Financial Settlement with OpenBanking Integration

Unlike previous platforms that digitized documents without bridging to real financial execution, our platform verifies OpenBanking payments directly on-chain. This means contractual terms can trigger actual monetary settlement in real-time without relying on external confirmation layers. It closes the gap between agreement and action—turning static digital records into truly executable contracts.

### Built on an Open EVM Chain for Maximum Interoperability

Whereas many earlier efforts relied on proprietary or permissioned chains (TradeLens with Hyperledger Fabric, Wave BL with a private chain), our platform is built on a public EVM-compatible chain. This ensures compatibility with the vast and growing DeFi ecosystem, allows for easy composability with other smart contract platforms, and minimizes onboarding friction for developers and enterprises alike.

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs Enable Privacy Without Compromising Trust

A major concern for prior initiatives—particularly TradeLens—was the exposure of sensitive business data. We address this directly through the use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). These allow parties to prove that conditions have been met or actions taken without revealing underlying confidential information. Businesses can now confidently participate in open blockchain ecosystems without risking proprietary data leakage.

### Executable Logic, Not Just Digital Paper

Where platforms like Wave BL and CargoX focused largely on replacing paper with PDFs on blockchain, we go further. Our agreements are not just digital representations—they are programmable, automated logic layers. They define rights, obligations, and triggers that self-execute under verifiable conditions, making them both human- and machine-legible, akin to the spirit of Ricardian Contracts but with modern cryptographic guarantees and settlement capabilities.

### Future-Ready, Global by Design

With multi-currency OpenBanking support, tokenized asset integration, and EVM-native smart contracts, our platform is designed to scale globally from day one. Whether it’s enabling supplier payment automation in Europe, validating trade finance guarantees in Asia, or executing tokenized agreements in the Americas—our infrastructure is built to bridge diverse financial and regulatory environments seamlessly.

## Summary
* Commercial agreements are foundational to global trade but are still plagued by inefficiencies, paper processes, and jurisdictional fragmentation.

* Programmable Commercial Agreements (PCAs) offer a powerful new paradigm: enforceable, transparent, automated contracts that exist natively on the blockchain.

* Previous initiatives like TradeLens, we.trade, Wave BL, and CargoX attempted to digitize trade processes, with varying degrees of success and limitations—particularly around privacy, interoperability, and execution.

* Our platform sets a new standard by solving these core limitations with:

    * Native on-chain settlement powered by OpenBanking integration

    * Maximum interoperability through public EVM compatibility

    * Privacy-preserving verification using zero-knowledge proofs

    * Executable smart contracts that automate commercial obligations

    * Global-ready infrastructure that bridges fiat, crypto, and traditional finance

## Conclusion
While previous attempts made clear the potential of blockchain in trade and commerce, they often fell short of delivering end-to-end utility. By rethinking how agreements are verified, executed, and enforced—natively and privately on-chain—we unlock the full promise of Programmable Commercial Agreements. This isn’t just a better contract. It’s a better way to do business globally.
